My Reflection
Initially, I assumed that it would be simple to be an IT student, but gradually, I came to know that I was mistaken. For instance, now we have another project to doâ€”a web portfolio. Initially, I believed it would be easy because we've done something close to it before, but when I began to do it again, I didn't know where or how to start, almost as if there was a force preventing me. Because the portfolio is personal, I came to realize that I must have a clear idea of who I am and what data best signifies me.
While developing my portfolio, I faced a number of challenges. I wrestled with where to begin, what to put in it, how to layout it, and how to arrange all the information that I collected. Another challenge arose when submitting, as uploading the document onto the site designated by my instructor was also another set of steps that I had to learn. To overcome these challenges, I conducted research on advice for building web portfolios and crafted a step-by-step guide to help me navigate. For submission, I tested the site to learn how to upload my file correctly.
I also learned that refining a portfolio begins with understanding yourself, since all the material will be your own expertise and experiences. A web portfolio is like a resume, so it must be clear and concise, with visually consistent formatting. It also must be responsive on multiple devices such as laptops, tablets, and phones. It should be easy to read, have the right font and colors to look good, be well organized like proper alignment, space, and contrast. Navigation must be accessible, and it should not repeat any section unnecessarily.
Ultimately, I realized that having a plan or process is crucial when doing something. Planning not only makes the task less difficult but also yields better outcomes. For example, you cannot simply begin constructing a web portfolio without preparation; the plan is your compass during the process. Finally, when doing something, you should not just think about your own preferences but also the needs and expectations of others.
